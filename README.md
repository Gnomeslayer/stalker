# Gnomes Stalker Bot
The stalker bot allows users to "stalk" any given user. Once you have a steam ID, URL or BMRCON Link, use the command and wait. <br />
Once a minute, the bot will search the targeted users profile to check if they've left a server or joined one. <br />
It will send this in a thread.
